		Library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. Thus, the process of handling a library manually is very troublesome and clumsy. As regards to this point of view, we plan to develop a computerized system for handling the activities of library management in a comprehensive way to lessen physical labor and reduce complexity of the manual system.
In this project, we plan on adding many features which are generally not available in a library management system. It will have features like user login, faculty login and admin login. It will also have a facility where student after logging in their accounts can see list of books issued and its issue date and return date and also the students can request the librarian to add new books through a request link.
Overall this project is being developed to help the students as well as staff of library to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.
